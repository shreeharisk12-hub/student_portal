# Novex — Never Miss an Opportunity Again  
### A Namma Hack 2026 Project by **Carpe Diem Team**

---

## 👋 Welcome to Carpe Diem Team

Welcome to **Novex**, our submission for **Namma Hack 2026**.

We are **Team Carpe Diem**, and this project is built around one simple belief:

> *Opportunities should not depend on luck, connections, or the right WhatsApp group.*

Novex is our attempt to build a more **transparent, organized, and equal** way for students to discover opportunities.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

In college, opportunities are everywhere — hackathons, ideathons, cultural events, workshops, competitions.

But **information about them is not.**

Through personal experience, we observed that:

- Important events are shared across **multiple WhatsApp groups**
- Messages get buried under **irrelevant chats and memes**
- Students often **mute groups** and miss critical announcements
- Different events exist in **different groups**, making tracking impossible
- First-year students are at a disadvantage due to **lack of connections**
- Many talented students miss opportunities simply because  
  **they never knew they existed**

> **Talent is evenly distributed.  
> Information is not.**

This is the problem Novex aims to solve.

## 💡 Our Solution — What is Novex?

Instead of relying on scattered messages and informal networks, Novex provides:

- A **single platform** for all verified events  
- Clear **deadlines and categories**  
- Separate dashboards for **students and admins**  
- Simple, scalable registration using **Google Forms**
