# Novex — Never Miss an Opportunity Again

## Problem Statement

In college, opportunities are everywhere — ideathons, hackathons, cultural events, gaming meetups — but **information about them is not**.

As a first-year student, I personally faced this problem when I **missed an ideathon entirely**. Later, I found out that a group from my own class participated and even won — simply because they *heard about it from the right person*.

This revealed a bigger issue:

- Important events are shared across **multiple WhatsApp groups**
- Event messages get buried under **irrelevant chats**
- Different events have **different groups** — joining all of them is unrealistic
- Students often **forget registration deadlines**
- First-year students are at a disadvantage due to **lack of connections**
- Opportunities depend more on *who you know* than *what you can do*

The problem is that it is cluttered —
buried inside random WhatsApp groups,
lost between unimportant messages.**

## Solution — What is Novex?

**Novex** is a centralized, interest-based event discovery platform for college students.

Instead of endless scrolling and noisy group chats, Novex ensures that:
- Students only see events **relevant to their interests**
- Important deadlines are **clearly visible**
- Opportunities reach students **equally**, regardless of connections or seniority

Novex focuses on **clarity, relevance, and accessibility**.

## How Novex Works (Current MVP)

### 1. Admin-Posted Events
- Events are added with:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Tags (e.g., coding, dance, gaming)
  - Registration deadline

*(In this MVP, admin posting is simulated using structured data.)*

---

### 2. Interest-Based Discovery
- Students select tags based on their interests
- Novex recommends events whose tags match student interests
- No irrelevant content, no endless scrolling

This ensures students don’t miss opportunities that actually matter to them.

---

### 3. Deadline Awareness
- Each event displays its registration deadline
- Helps students act on time instead of missing chances due to forgotten dates

---

### 4. Gaming & Connection Tags
- Gaming-related tags (e.g., Among Us, BGMI)
- Students with similar interests can discover each other
- Reduces dependency on existing friend circles

---

## Why Novex Matters

- Solves **information overload** instead of adding more content
- Helps **first-year students** compete on equal ground
- Reduces dependence on WhatsApp groups
- Ensures opportunities reach the **right people**, not just the most connected ones

Novex is not about replacing communities — it’s about **making opportunities visible**.

## Tech Stack (MVP)

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JSON (simulated database)
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

This MVP focuses on **demonstrating the core idea**, not full-scale production.

---

## Scope & Limitations

This is an early-stage MVP designed to validate the concept.

Features intentionally kept out of scope:
- User authentication
- Real-time chat
- Admin dashboard UI
- Advanced AI models

These are planned for future iterations.

---

## Future Scope

- Admin dashboard for event posting
- User accounts & personalized feeds
- AI-driven recommendations based on interaction history
- Notifications for approaching deadlines
- Real-time student connections & chat
- Mobile application

---

## Personal Motivation

This project was built based on a **real experience of missing an opportunity** due to poor information flow.

Novex aims to ensure that no student misses out — not because of lack of skill, but because of lack of information.

---

## Conclusion

Novex is a step towards a more **transparent, inclusive, and organized** way of sharing opportunities in college.

Opportunities shouldn’t depend on luck or connections.  
They should be visible to everyone.
